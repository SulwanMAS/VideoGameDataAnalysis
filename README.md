The dataset that I took is from kaggle https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/gregorut/videogamesales which is the basic premise of the project that I have made.

# Context of Project

MindGames which is a mid-sized game studio would like to create a game and profit over it and require some datas to be analysed to
maximize their revenue potential and see what is the trend of the current market for video games.

They have allocated $15M budget to use and would like to properly utilize the money that they have invested with as many information
as the data analysts that they hire could give.

The stakeholders are giving the data analysts these core questions such as :
1. Genre Selection : Which genre has the highest market efficiency?
2. Platform Priotization : What Platform is the best way to get as many customers possible?
3. Regional Localization : How should we tailor our marketing strategy to each region?
